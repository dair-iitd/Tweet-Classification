So far, more than 100,000 Kashmiri people have been killed in a reign of terror and repression unleashed by over 10,00,000 troops. Many more languish in Indian jails where they are subjected to torture and custodial deaths. #Freekashmir #BlackDay    '
India sought to suppress their movement with massive use of force, killing hundreds of innocent men, women and children. This led some of the #Kashmiri youth to take up arms in self defence. #Freekashmir #BlackDay      #Kashmir'
